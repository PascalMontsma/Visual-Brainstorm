# Visual-Brainstorm
Visual brainstorm exercise. Create characters with personality!

The basic idea is to have a couple of dozen circles. Preferably with a lighter color fill, but that is not really important for the outcome.

What you need:
- An average marker, black or dark blue will do the job just fine.
- A timer that is set to 30 seconds can be reset easily. Or one that will give you an alarm every 30 seconds until you stop the timer.
- All you need now is the word, Go!
